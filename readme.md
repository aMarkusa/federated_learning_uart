# Federated Learning Over UART

## Introduction
This project serves as a proof of concept for federated learning using ARM Cortex-M MCUs (in this case Silabs MG24). The communication between the training server and the clients is implemented in UART, but will be replaced with BLE at a later stage. Also, the simple linear regression model will be replaced with somethin a bit more impressive, such as deep learning, when I've gained the required knowledge.

My initial goal with this project was to create a framework that could be used to implement federated learning in IoT networks. This would the framework would be portable between different communication protocols.
